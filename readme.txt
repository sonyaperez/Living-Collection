This project was very challenging for me. One of the hardest things 
was making the first page look good for <600px. I have a hard time 
visualizing, so moving between large and small screen size was tedious, 
and ultimately I wish I had figured out a way to make the layout nearly identical 
for both. 

The speech bubbles on mobile were particularly difficult because the triangle 
part would overlap. I fixed this a bit by making it the same white color as the bubble. They 
lined up by default on desktop, but I wasn't sure how to accomplish that the same way on mobile. I referenced
a lot of older CSS guides and videos to create that in a style that I felt fit the site aesthetic.

The avatar of myself was created using an app on iPhone called "MyLittleStar." I've used it as a 
profile picture online for games, so it felt fitting. I actually had to replace this one a few 
times because the shoes were transparent after I had removed the background using Adobe InDesign. 

I wanted to add music to the homepage to make it feel more like a game, but I figured that 
would be overstimulating. 

"Content" is a literal gallery of my work. All except for the last two, the flowcharts, reference 
links. For this, I had to turn the repositories of all my projects into domains using Github pages.
Unfortunately, it does not open the domain as its own tab, so the user has to use the browser
back button to return to the gallery.

If the user wanted to view the code, they could do so through my profile.
Looking back, I'm glad that I decided to keep my comments while making the project in the files. 
"Read me" files and comments in the code I feel like could really give the user a look into 
my thought process while making them. It is similar to a description next to a painting in a real 
gallery. 

The "thumbnails" for the works are just the first page, but they're not perfect. I
wanted to show the entire first page, but I wasn't sure how do to that for every design 
consistently with the grid layout. 

For "insights," I didn't really know that to include, just that I wanted 
a section for my thoughts about these projects, if the user ended up not examining the code 
and reading all my comments. I experimenting with adding a gif. 
I tried out a scroll text effect I had used before, with some tweaking.
I struggled a lot with making things like the text fully aligned. 

I wanted to include as many elements from class as I could:
-Detailed alt descriptions for accessibility purposes.
-"Canvas" element in JS to animate background color. I updated it from 
"Stories as Networks" to be shades of magenta.
-Personal design style.
-Github domains. 

I hope to continue my Communication Design journey, because I do enjoy 
web design. I hope to gain more skills and apply them in the most efficient ways possible.
