<!--Reflection text about the course and projects.-->
<p>Throughout this course, I have experimented with a variety of styling techniques and have 
    gained a better understanding of layouts. I have taken my previous knowledge from a Lang coding class I took last semester and applied it to this work.
    </p> 

    <p>
        Creating flags was never something that I had done before, and it was a bit challenging since 
        they all had to be on the same page. The flag of Nepal was especially challenging. If I were 
        to do it again, I would have adjusted margins and padding to make it appear higher on the page.  
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript has always been a weak spot for me when it comes to text interaction, but not 
            so much with access to cameras and such, as that is something I have implemented in the past.
            
            </p>
        
            <p>I've found that I really love retro styles, as reflected in the design of 
                this site. I like combining older aesthetics with newer web techniques.
            </p>
        <p>
            Creating digital sitemaps and flowcharts gives me a better understanding 
            of how to structure and organize web content for my own sites. I've always 
            been a visual learner, so creating diagrams before coding really helps me plan 
            better.
        </p>

            <p id="bottom">I hope to further improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills because web design is something that has always fascinated me. It is challenging, fun, and rewarding.</p>
